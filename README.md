_Image classification_

## Recycling
According to the [Waste Framework Directive](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/scientific-activities-z/less-waste-more-value/definition-recycling_en), **recycling** is defined as

>  "any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes"

### Beyond recycling
For a long time, we all became familiar with the 3R's (Recycling, Reduce, Reuse), but that concept is obsolete and more R's and other letters in the alphabet have joined the team in an effort to fight climate change, biodiversity loss, habitat fragmentation, desertification and much more.

## Aim of the project

The aim of the project is to help people navigate the sometimes confussing world of recycling.

## How does it work? :camera:
1. User uploads a photo
2. Photo is processed and classified by the model
3. Result is printed on the screen and registered in a pie chart where the user can see the total of her/his/their queries and classifications. The classes that the model registers in this first version are:
    - Glass
    - Organic
    - Paper and carton
    - Yellow (plastic and metal)
    - Recycling point (e-waste, clothes, shoes, furniture)
